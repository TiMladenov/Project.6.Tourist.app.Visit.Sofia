# Project 6: Tourist app - "Visit Sofia"
v2.0 of Udacity Project 3 - Quiz application

# Description
In this project, I made my own multi-screen Android app to share my knowledge about a city I was very familiar with.
The goal was to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting this city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. The app doesn't use networking to get the data, it is hard coded in the app.

While creating this application, I was able to put to use the following skills and knowledge:
- Planning my app design and navigation before coding.
- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
- Building layouts to display those lists of data.
- Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
- Creating my own custom classes.
- Properly handling images.

# Requirements
The design must include:
- Layout:
  - The app contains at least 4 lists of relevant attractions for a location.
  - The user can navigate between lists using a central screen, a NavDrawer, or a View pager.
  - Each list item contains information about an event, restaurant, historical site, or similar. 
  - At least one list includes pictures of the location. 
  - The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
    - Text sizes are defined in sp.
    - Lengths are defined in dp.
    - Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
- Functionality:
  - The app contains a custom object for storing location information.
  - App uses a custom adapter to populate the layout with views based on instances of the custom class. 
  - All strings are stored in the strings.xml resource file.
  - All images are stored as drawables. All drawables are stored at multiple densities.
  - The code runs without errors. 
- Code Readability:
  - The code is easily readable such that a fellow programmer can understand the purpose of the app.
  - All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
  - The code is properly formatted:
    - No unnecessary blank lines.
    - No unused variables or methods.
    - No commented out code.
    - The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
